# Yabeda::Datadog

Adapter for easy exporting collected custom metrics from your application to the [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/).


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

1. Go to [API integration page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api) and create API and APP keys.

2. Set keys in configure initializer

    ```ruby
    Yabeda.configure do
      self.datadog_api_key = ENV['datadog_api_key']
      self.datadog_app_key = ENV['datadog_app_key']
      self.host = 'production' # name of application
      ...
    end
    ```

3. All metrics registered in Yabeda will be sent to Datadog automatically.
